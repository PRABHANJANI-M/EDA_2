# 💧 Water Potability Analysis
📌 Overview

Access to safe drinking water is essential for human health. The Water Potability Dataset helps analyze water quality using different physical, chemical, and biological properties. This project aims to study the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build insights/models that classify whether water is safe for consumption (Potable) or unsafe (Non-Potable).

The dataset can be used for:

Understanding the role of water quality parameters.

Identifying correlations between features.

Building machine learning models to predict water safety.

# 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains measurements of water quality indicators and a binary target variable:

pH → Acidity/basicity of water (normal range: 6.5–8.5).

Hardness → Mineral content (calcium & magnesium salts).

Solids → Total dissolved solids in ppm.

Chloramines → Amount of disinfectant present in ppm.

Sulfate → Sulfate ion concentration in mg/L.

Conductivity → Electrical conductivity of water.

Organic Carbon → Measure of organic contaminants.

Trihalomethanes → Chemical compounds formed after chlorination.

Turbidity → Clarity of water.

Potability → Target variable (1 = Safe, 0 = Unsafe).

🔍 Data Analysis

Key steps in the analysis:

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values.

Checking for outliers and anomalies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics of each feature.

Distribution plots (histograms, KDE).

Correlation heatmaps to identify strong relationships.

Feature Engineering

Creating categorical features (e.g., high_ph, high_hardness).

Normalizing/standardizing continuous features.

Predictive Modeling (optional)

Training ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

# ✨ Features of This Project

Cleaned and well-documented dataset processing.

Category creation for easy interpretation (e.g., safe/unsafe ranges).

Visual insights using plots (scatter plots, histograms, correlation maps).

Potability prediction using ML algorithms.

Scalable analysis – works for both small and large datasets.

# 📊 Insights

pH values outside 6.5–8.5 range indicate unsafe water.

High solids or turbidity levels reduce water quality.

Chloramines and trihalomethanes need to be within safe limits to avoid harmful health effects.

Machine learning can effectively classify potable vs. non-potable water with good accuracy.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy → Data manipulation & analysis.

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization.

Scikit-learn → Machine learning models.

(Optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Deploying a web app to predict water potability from user input.

Integrating with real-world IoT water quality sensors.

Building an interactive dashboard for monitoring water safety.

Adding time-series analysis for monitoring changes in water quality over time.

📂 Example Use Case

A water treatment facility can use this analysis to monitor and classify water samples.

Health agencies can identify regions at risk of unsafe water supply.

Researchers can study relationships between chemical indicators and potability.<img width="571" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0e3447f-aa5b-4d67-a95e-9f758be82ea0" />
